# ModusToolbox™ Software Training

This page contains links to ModusToolbox™ training classes that are available on GitHub. These classes are organized in a modular fashion and broken into levels. Each class is focused on a specific area so that you can learn about a topic quicker and build upon your knowledge as your needs evolve.

## Getting started

- [ModusToolbox™ Getting Started](https://github.com/infineon/training-modustoolbox-level1-getting-started) - This is the entry-level ModusToolbox™ training class with course material and excercises.

- [PSOC™ Developer Journey](https://www.infineon.com/product-information/psocdeveloper/develop) - This is a link to the developer journey page, with a series of videos that guide you through the basic MCU development flow, as well as several DEEPCRAFT™ Studio development flows.

- [Infineon Academy](https://infineon-academy.csod.com/ui/lms-learner-search/search?pageNumber=1&query=Modustoolbox) - This is a link to the Infineon Academy page. Here you'll find videos about ModusToolbox™, as well as many other Infineon products and services.

## Device family-specific training

- [ModusToolbox™ training - PSOC™ 6, PSOC™ 4, and AIROC™ CYW20829 MCUs](https://github.com/infineon/training-modustoolbox-level2-psoc) - This is a 2nd level ModusToolbox™ training class. It covers PSOC™ 6, PSOC™ 4 and CYW20829 MCUs.

- [ModusToolbox™ Straining – XMC7000 and TRAVEO T2G MCUs](https://github.com/infineon/training-modustoolbox-level2-xmc7x) - This is a 2nd level ModusToolbox™ training class. It covers XMC7000 and TRAVEO™ T2G MCUs.

- [ModusToolbox™ training – AIROC™ Bluetooth® SDK (BTSDK) MCUs](https://github.com/infineon/training-modustoolbox-level2-btsdk) - This is a 2nd level ModusToolbox™ training class. It covers MCUs using the BTSDK API including the CYW20819, CYW20820, CYW20835, and CYW43012 (in embedded mode).

## Device feature-specific training

- [ModusToolbox™ training - Bluetooth® Type1 and Type2](https://github.com/infineon/training-modustoolbox-level3-bluetooth) - This is a pair of classes to teach how to use Bluetooth® Low Energy in ModusToolbox™ applications. The Type1 class applies to AIROC™ Bluetooth® devices paired with an external host (such as CYW43012 + PSOC™ 6) and AIROC™ Bluetooth® devices with two MCUs (such as PSOC™ 63 and CYW20829). The Type2 class applies to AIROC™ Bluetooth® devices with a single MCU (such as CYW20835). While the interaction with the MCU is different, the basic Bluetooth® operation is the same in both classes, so you can choose whichever one best suits your needs.

- [ModusToolbox™ training - Wi-Fi](https://github.com/infineon/training-modustoolbox-level3-wifi) - This is a class to teach how to use Wi-Fi in ModusToolbox™ applications. The descriptions and exercises use a PSOC™ 6 MCU as a host to a CYW43012 connectivity device.

- [ModusToolbox™ training - Machine learning](https://github.com/infineon/training-modustoolbox-level3-machine-learning) - This is a class to teach how to use the ModusToolbox™ machine learning solution. The descriptions and exercises use a PSOC™ 6 MCU along with motion sensors and microphones to develop IoT applications for gesture detection, keyword detection, etc.
