# ModusToolbox™ Software Training

This page contains links to ModusToolbox™ training classes that are available on GitHub. These classes are organized in a modular fashion and broken into levels. Each class is focused on a specific area so that you can learn about a topic quicker and build upon your knowledge as your needs evolve.

- [ModusToolbox™ Software Training Level 1 - Getting Started](https://github.com/infineon/training-modustoolbox-level1-getting-started) - This is the entry-level ModusToolbox™ training class. It is a pre-requisite for all level 2 and level 3 ModusToolbox™ training classes.

- [ModusToolbox™ Software Training Level 2 – CAT 1 & 2 MCUs](https://github.com/infineon/training-modustoolbox-level2-psoc) - This is a 2nd level ModusToolbox™ training class. It covers CAT1 and CAT 2 MCUs which includes PSoC™ 6, PSoC™ 4 and CYW20829.

- [ModusToolbox™ Software Training Level 2 – XMC7000 and TRAVEO T2G MCUs](https://github.com/infineon/training-modustoolbox-level2-xmc7x) - This is a 2nd level ModusToolbox™ training class. It covers XMC7000 and TRAVEO™ T2G MCUs.

- [ModusToolbox™ Software Training Level 2 – AIROC™ Bluetooth® SDK (BTSDK) MCUs](https://github.com/infineon/training-modustoolbox-level2-btsdk) - This is a 2nd level ModusToolbox™ training class. It covers MCUs using the BTSDK API including the CYW20819, CYW20820, CYW20835, and CYW43012 (in embedded mode).

- [ModusToolbox™ Software Training Level3 Bluetooth® Type1 and Type2](https://github.com/infineon/training-modustoolbox-level3-bluetooth) - This is a pair of classes to teach how to use Bluetooth® Low Energy in ModusToolbox™ applications. The Type1 class applies to AIROC™ Bluetooth® devices paired with an external host (such as CYW43012 + PSoC™ 6) and AIROC™ Bluetooth® devices with two MCUs (such as PSoC™ 63 and CYW20829). The Type2 class applies to AIROC™ Bluetooth® devices with a single MCU (such as CYW20835). While the interaction with the MCU is different, the basic Bluetooth® operation is the same in both classes, so you can choose whichever one best suits your needs.

- [ModusToolbox™ Software Training Level 3 - Wi-Fi](https://github.com/infineon/training-modustoolbox-level3-wifi) - This is a class to teach how to use Wi-Fi in ModusToolbox™ applications. The descriptions and exercises use a PSoC™ 6 MCU as a host to a CYW43012 connectivity device.

- [ModusToolbox™ Software Training Level 3 - Machine Learning](https://github.com/infineon/training-modustoolbox-level3-machine-learning) - This is a class to teach how to use the ModusToolbox™ Machine Learning solution. The descriptions and exercises use a PSoC™ 6 MCU along with motion sensors and microphones to develop IoT applications for gesture detection, keyword detection, etc.
