# ModusToolbox™ Software Training

This page contains links to ModusToolbox training classes that are available on GitHub. These classes are done in a modular fashion and are broken into levels. The purpose is that each class is focussed on a specific area so that you can learn about a topic quicker and can build upon your knowledge as your needs evolve.

The level 1 getting started class covers the basic concepts and building blocks of ModusToolbox. Level 2 classes cover a product or product family such as PSoC™. Level 3 classes cover more advanced systems such as Bluetooth®, Wi-Fi, or Machine Learning.

[ModusToolbox™ Software Training Level 1 - Getting Started](https://github.com/infineon/training-modustoolbox-level1-getting-started)

- This is the entry-level ModusToolbox™ training class. It is a pre-requisite for all level 2 and level 3 ModusToolbox™ training classes.

- This class is a survey of the ModusToolbox™ development platform.  The learning objective is to introduce you to all the tools in the ModusToolbox™ ecoysystem and help you develop some familiarity with using them.  The class is “a mile wide and an inch deep.”  This should enable you to understand the scope of the development ecosystem and teach you where to find “everything.”

[ModusToolbox™ Software Training Level 2 – PSoC™ MCUs](https://github.com/infineon/training-modustoolbox-level2-psoc)

- This is a 2nd level ModusToolbox™ training class. It covers PSoC™ 6 and PSoC™ 4 MCUs.

[ModusToolbox™ Software Training Level 3 - Wi-Fi](https://github.com/infineon/training-modustoolbox-level3-wifi)

- This is a class to teach how to use Wi-Fi in ModusToolbox™ applications. The descriptions and exercises use a PSoC™ 6 MCU as a host to a 43012 connectivity device.

[ModusToolbox™ Software Training Level 3 - Bluetooth®](https://github.com/infineon/training-modustoolbox-level3-bluetooth)

- This is a class to teach how to use Bluetooth® Low Energy in ModusToolbox™ applications. The descriptions and exercises use a PSoC™ 6 MCU as a host to a 43012 connectivity device.

- After completing this class, you should be able to create and debug full Bluetooth® applications using the ModusToolbox™ ecosystem including peripherals, centrals, and beacons.

[ModusToolbox™ Software Training Level 3 - Bluetooth® Mesh](https://github.com/infineon/training-modustoolbox-level3-bluetooth-mesh)

- This is a class to teach how to use Bluetooth® mesh in ModusToolbox™ applications. The descriptions and exercises use a PSoC™ 6 MCU as a host to a 43012 connectivity device.
